# ipc-rs

> **Note**: this crate was never published on crates.io and never finished. It may contain some salvageable code but hasn't been maintained in years, so the repository is archived. There's not currently a drop-in replacement for this on crates.io, but crates.io likely has the same functionality in it somewhere.
